# Getting Started

## Frontend Setup

To run the frontend of this project, follow these steps:

Navigate to the `FrontEnd` directory:

   ```bash
   cd FrontEnd
   ```
Install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
  npm install
```

Several libraries are used in the project, including those for styling and charts, so this step is essential.

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application should automatically open in your browser at http://localhost:3000. If it doesn't, you can manually navigate to that URL.

## Backend Setup

To run the backend, follow these steps:

Navigate to the backend/src directory:

```bash
cd backend/src
```
Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
Ensure that port 3000 is available on your system. If it's not, you can change the port by editing the .env file:

```bash
PORT=your_desired_port_number√á
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
node app.js
```
